##Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN and TensorFlow
#Overview
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing emotions from facial images. The model is trained on an image dataset with labeled facial expressions. The dataset is processed to crop the faces, resize them, and prepare the images for model training. The trained model can classify images into seven different emotions with high accuracy.

#Features
Image preprocessing: face detection, cropping, and resizing
CNN model architecture with multiple convolutional layers
Use of learning rate scheduling and early stopping
Training, validation, and testing with accuracy and loss curves
Evaluation on the test dataset

#Dataset
The dataset consists of images with labeled facial expressions. For each image, the face is detected and cropped based on provided bounding box coordinates. After cropping, the faces are resized to 64x64 pixels for model input.

#Model Architecture
-The CNN model has the following layers:
-Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
-Max-pooling layers for downsampling
-Dense layers for final classification
-Dropout for regularization
-Softmax output for classifying the seven emotions

#Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python

#Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-emotion-recognition.git

. Navigate to the project directory:
cd facial-emotion-recognition

3. Run the training script:
python train.py

#Evaluation
The model is evaluated on a test dataset. Performance metrics such as test accuracy and loss are reported, along with a confusion matrix and classification report to analyze the results.

#Results
The training and validation accuracy and loss curves are plotted to visualize the model's performance over time. The final test accuracy is also provided.
